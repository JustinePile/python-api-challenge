# WeatherPy
* Generates a random set of a latitude and longitutde coordinates 
* Takes those coordinates and finds the nearest city with `citipy` 
* Finally, uses the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain weather data given those cities, so as to allow analysis on linear relationships between latitude and variables including max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed, with the data split between the two hemispheres
